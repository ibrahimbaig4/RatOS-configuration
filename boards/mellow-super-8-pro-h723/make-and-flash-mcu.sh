# The first time the board is booted after the jumper has been installed
# the board needs to be flashed via the dfu vendor:device id. After that
# it can be flashed via the /dev/mellow-super-8-pro path, but it then fails
# to exit dfu mode, and then one needs to flash it yet again with the
# vendor:device id. Then it correctly exits DFU mode. Except those times
# where it doesn't, for that we have a 3rd pass...
